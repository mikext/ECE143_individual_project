    "\n",
    "### Part 1 *Trimming Algorithm*:   \n",
    "This part deals with how to trim a new tower area when a new tower is added. This is the core algorithm in this project. I build the trimming algorithm on top of an algorithm that finds the largest area in a histogram. This trimming algorithm is very efficient (time complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are width and height of new tower's pre-trimming coverage).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2 *Drawing Function*:\n",
    "This drawing function takes towers' coordinates as input(untrimmed and trimmed), gives an animation of adding and trimming new towers using matplotlib. Towers are represented in different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3 *Utilities*:\n",
    "This part includes necessary utility functions to implement the working pipeline. For example, function to generate random new towers, function to check if the area is fully covered, function to plot analysis graph, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4 *Solving Problems*:\n",
    "**This part are functions that addresses three problems listed in project description. Graders can run functions in this part to see the solutions to these problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5 *Discussion and Analysis*:\n",
    "This part discuss the reason why I choose this algorithm and also give some analysis results about this coverage problem."

    "The core algorithm implemented in this project is a **\"stack-based\" algorithm** to find largest rectangle in the \"remain_area\" of a new tower after subtracting overlapped regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, I was trying a **brute force** method to search every possible rectangles in the \"remain_area\". However, it turns out that the time complexity of this algorithm is unacceptable. Considering a new tower's coverage is (width \\* height) = (m \\* n):\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use brute force search:\n",
    "    1. we need to iterate over every element in this area as \"left up corner\". (~ m * n)\n",
    "    2. on top of previous iteration, we need to iterate over 1 to m as width of found rectangle. (~ m)\n",
    "    3. on top of previous iterations, we need to iterate over 1 to n as length of found rectangle. (~ n)\n",
    "    In total the time complexity is O((m * n) ^ 2).\n",
    "If we use this stack-based search:\n",
    "    1. In the process of finding largest histogram in every row, every element in this row is put in and popped out of the stack for only once. (~ m).\n",
    "    2. We scan the rows for just once, for every row we calculate the possible largest histogram as the possible largest rectangle. (~ n)\n",
    "    In total the time complexity is O(m * n)\n",
    "From above discussion we can see how much time stack-based search can save for us."
