    "### Part 1 *Trimming Algorithm*:   \n",
    "This part deals with how to trim a new tower area when a new tower is added. This is the core algorithm in this project. I build the trimming algorithm on top of an algorithm that finds the largest area in a histogram. This trimming algorithm is very efficient (time complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are width and height of new tower area).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2 *Drawing Function*:\n",
    "This drawing function takes towers' coordinates as input(untrimmed and trimmed), gives an animation of adding and trimming new towers using matplotlib. Towers are represented in different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3 *Utilities*:\n",
    "This part includes necessary utility functions to implement the working pipeline. For example, function to generate random new towers, function to check if the area is fully covered, function to plot analysis graph, etc..\n",

    "### Part 4 *Solving Problems*:\n",
